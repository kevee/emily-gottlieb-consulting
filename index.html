      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an artist, ecologist, and educator. I grew up in Connecticut and
        earned a Bachelors in Studio Art from Oberlin College and a Masters in
        Marine Biodiversity and Conservation from Scripps Institution of
        Oceanography at UC San Diego. I've traveled from California, to Hawaii,
        to Alaska, working as an environmental educator, and I have been
        managing community science (aka citizen science) programs since 2013. I
        spent 2019 researching intertidal ecology and community science in
        Argentina under a Fulbright grant. When I am not developing programs, I
        am climbing mountains with my watercolor paints, traipsing around tide
        pools, and riding ocean waves. I live with my son, husband, and our
        ridiculous dog in Seaside, California.
